# Say :wave: to Object Locker!

## I am a Discord bot trying to help avoid merge conflicts in (Game) Dev Teams :innocent:

If you're using `git` as your version control and want to work on non-mergeable object, like `Unity Scenes` or `Prefabs`, you can definitely use me to tell all of the team members that you're working on them!

The channels in your Discord is meant to be seen as ***one*** project, so if you're working on multiple projects, you can have coordinated working without polluting the lock status of other channels.

Try using `!lock yourSceneName` to announce **I'M WORKING ON THIS :kissing_heart:**  
When you're finished, use `!unlock yourSceneName` to say **I'M DONE WITH THIS :sunglasses:**

Whenever you want to know who is working on what on a project/channel, use `!lockstatus`  
If you're feeling curious, you can use `!lockstatus server` to see all locked objects in the whole server.

Don't understand something? Use `!help` or `!help [command name]` to let me explain stuff to you!
