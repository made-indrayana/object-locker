# Say :wave: to Object Locker

## I am a Discord bot trying to help avoid merge conflicts in (Game) Dev Teams :innocent:

If you're using `git` as your version control and want to work on non-mergeable object, like `Unity Scenes` or `Prefabs`, you can definitely use me to tell all of the team members that you're working on them!

You can call me in an already existing channel (or dedicated) for your project. If you're working on multiple projects, you can call me in multiple channels without polluting the lock status of other projects! *p.s. I also keep the channel tidy!*

Try using `!lock yourSceneName` or `!lock scene01 scene02`to announce **I'M WORKING ON THIS :kissing_heart:**  
<img alt="Locking objects" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/made-indrayana/object-locker/imgs/lock-gif.gif" width=70%>  

When you're finished, use `!unlock` or `!unlock sceneName` or even `!unlock scene01 scene02 prefabA`to say **I'M DONE WITH THE ONES I'M WORKING :sunglasses:**  
<img alt="Unlocking objects" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/made-indrayana/object-locker/imgs/unlock-gif.gif" width=70%>

Whenever you want to know who is working on what on a project/channel, use `!lockstatus`  
If you're feeling curious, you can use `!lockstatus server` to see all locked objects in the whole server.

Don't understand something? Use `!help` or `!help [command name]` to let me explain stuff to you!
