        If you're using \`git\` as your version control and want to work on non-mergeable object, like \`Unity Scenes\` or \`Prefabs\`, you can definitely use me to tell all of the team members that you're working on them!

        The channels in your Discord channel is meant to be seen as ***one*** project, so if you're working on multiple projects, this is a win for you!
        
        Try using
        \`!lock yourSceneName\`
        to announce **I'M WORKING ON THIS :nerd:**

        When you're finished, use
        \`!unlock yourSceneName\`
        to say **I'M DONE WITH THIS :sunglasses:**
        
        Whenever you want to know who is working on what on a project, use
        \`!lockstatus\`

        If you're feeling curious, you can use
        \`!lockstatus server\`
        to see all locked objects in the whole server.
        
        Don't understand something? Use \`!help\` or \`!help [command name]\` to let me explain stuff to you!`;
